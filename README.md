# twitterprojects

This is a small script that pulls all your bookmarks or profile tweets to a csv file (depending on which program you run).

If on windows, you must put the .py file along with chromedriver.exe inside the same folder, as the driver is required for the script to work.
If you're on macOs follow the instructions within the .py (at the top).


If you're on windows you can run the .py file by:

0 - Installing python

1 - Opening cmd

2 - Typing "python" and then the path to the .py

As example: python C:\Users\myUsername\Desktop\TwitterScraper\TwitterBookmarkScraper.py


If you're on macOs you can run the .py file by:

0 - Installing python

1 - Opening Terminal

2 - Typing "python" and then the path to the .py

As example: python /Users/myUsername/Documents/TwitterScraper/TwitterBookmarkScraper.py
