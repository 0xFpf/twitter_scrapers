# twitterprojects

This is a small script that pulls all your bookmarks or profile tweets to a csv file (depending on which program you run).


Installation instructions--


If on windows, you must put the .py file along with chromedriver.exe inside the same folder, as the driver is required for the script to work.
If you're on macOs, download the macOS version then put the chromedriver.exe just outside the .py's folder, and then input the path to the chromedriver once you run the application.


Instructions to run the script--


If you're on windows you can run the .py file by:

0 - Installing python

1 - Opening cmd

2 - Typing "python" and then the path to the .py

As example: python C:\Users\myUsername\Desktop\TwitterScraper\TwitterBookmarkScraper.py


If you're on macOs you can run the .py file by:

0 - Installing python

1 - Opening Terminal

2 - Typing "python" and then the path to the .py
